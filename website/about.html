					<p>Hello. We’re ADAM &amp; AOKI, a technology company dedicated to developing next generation
						smart clothing. We go beyond being a brand. We’re a movement revolutionising the interactions
						between people and everyday wear.
						Our innovative clothing range warns users that they are in risk of getting sunburnt. Using
						specially developed smart fabric, our products detect dangerous UV rays and warn you via a
						clear colour change. The warning system also takes into account both your skin type and the
						time it takes you to burn, and doesn’t require phones, apps or electronics.
						Welcome to clothing 4.0, where functionality meets fashion.</p>

						<h3>Contacts</h3>
						<h1>Questions about the product?</h1>
						<p>product@adamaoki.com</p>
						<h1>Questions about your order?</h1>
						<p>order@adamaoki.com</p>
						<h1>Inquiries directly to the founders of A&amp;A?</h1>

						<h3>Mission</h3>
						<p>ADAM &amp; AOKI is on a mission to make clothes smarter. For thousands of years we’ve focused
							on practically in clothing and that time has come to an end. It’s time to start wearing clothes that
							not only look and feel great, but also help us to overcome everyday challenges like sunburn.</p>
							<h3>Vision</h3>
							<p>We believe that as a business, our aim should be to try to make the world a better place. That’s
								why our vision is to produce sustainable smart clothing on a global scale that is specially
								designed to help solve millions of real-world problems, each and every day.</p>
								<h3>What makes us ADAM &amp; AOKI</h3>
								<ul>
									<li> #changeit. If you’re unhappy or upset with something, be the agent of change.</li>
									<li> Transparency. No good ever came of lies and secrecy. Just ask Romeo &amp; Juliet.</li>
									<li> Doing good. Solving real world problems is what gets us out of bed in the morning and we’d
										like to keep it that way.</li>
										<li> Persevere. Let’s agree to never give up on our individual and shared challenges.</li>
										<li> Sustainability. We ❤ planet earth, but for it to keep being planet earth we need to take care of
											it.</li>
											<li> Focus on priorities and prioritise focus. All the unimportant stuff can wait.</li>
											<li> Being busy is a mindset. You’re never too busy to do something. You just didn’t make time for
												it and that’s fine with us.</li>
												<li> Be forever flexibile. If a 90 year old can do the splits what’s your excuse?</li>
												<li> Have Fun. Nothing — and we really mean nothing — should be boring. Including socks.</li>
												<li> Stay Curious. They say curiosity killed the cat but we promise it won’t kill you. Quite the
													opposite in fact.</li>
													<li> Sharing. We think you’re amazing and we genuinely mean it. Only thing we ask is that you
														share your amazingness with everyone around you.</li>
													</ul>

													<h3>The Founder's Story</h3>
													<blockquote>
														Back in the day I was a terrible teen, running riot. Football and females were pretty much my
														only interest, despite my parents best attempts to convince me it might be worth listening in
														school.<br><br>
														Fortunately I was - and luckily still am - surrounded by some amazing people. My Grandparents,
														who lived through WWII, were always on hand valuable and candid advice. My brother Ben,
														who has more often that not been a voice of reason. And there was Gerry, one of my mother’s
														best friend and an unofficial mentor to me.<br>
														I admired Gerry from the get go. A gentlemen, championing the fight against important causes
														like elder abuse and gay rights, and an unintended comedy genius. He was once at a ceremony
														with the then president Bill Clinton, and beamed as he told how he was close enough to take
														great photos. He couldn’t wait to get them developed. Only problem was he’d forgotten to put
														film in his camera.<br><br>
														One of the first times I met him he parked his car in central London a spot that probably wasn’t
														meant to be parked in. Having stepped out the car, he walked over to the ticket machine. A few
														buttons later, the machine broke and spat out a bunch of pound coins but no ticket. He
														proclaimed that he thought “it would probably be ok” and proceeded to give me the change. The
														act typified his unselfishness.<br><br>
														Sadly Gerry died of cancer in 2013. As a young man he had skin cancer (melanoma),
														developed from too much skin damage acquired from excessive sunbathing. Even though he
														beat skin cancer a young man, he died of lung cancer — which was caused by melanoma
														cancer cells that had remained from his first battle with cancer.<br><br>
														ADAM &amp; AOKI is for you Gerry. I hope you’d be proud.
